# Token42Art White-paper  
*“Spirit Animals for the 42 Écosystem”*

---

### Vision  
Token42Art is a **limited BEP-721 collection** of four spirit animals—Crocodile, Fox, Owl and Whale—each hiding the number **42** in its design.  
They serve as **digital mascots** for every 42 student: profile-picture, desktop wallpaper, or simply a good-luck charm that lives on-chain.

---

### Collection Specs  
- **Chain**: BNB Smart Chain (Test-net)  
- **Standard**: BEP-721 (OpenZeppelin)  
- **Supply**: 4 unique pieces (1/1 each)  
- **Storage**: IPFS folder `bafybeia…` (images + JSON)  
- **Artist**: cromalde (42 login)  
- **License**: CC-BY-NC 4.0 – free to use, not for commercial resale.

---

### Utility & Culture  
- **Profile-picture** in Discord / Slack / LinkedIn.  
- **Wallpaper pack** included (1024×1024).  
- **Future expansion**: DAO vote to mint additional spirits or animated versions.
