Android Develpoment project at 42Roma

This is a first approach to android Sdk, the goal is to code a "Clone" on the Android app Hangouts

Is a contact manager app, in witch user can add/edit/remove contacts, once added is possibile to chat via Sms.
The app runs an instance of a SqlLiteDb to persist data, works in portrait & landscape.

As "Bonus" features the user can Call a contact, add an UserImage of that contact and if a SmsMessage is received from a number that is not in the contact list
it will be added with the PhoneNumber as name

The app infrastructure is deisgned in Activity and use the Material Ui Component
